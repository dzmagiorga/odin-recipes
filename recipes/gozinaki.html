    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gozinaki is a Georgian sweet traditionally prepared for the new year. 
        It's made of caramelized nuts, usually walnuts, fried in honey.
        It's basically a honey and nut brittle.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cup of walnuts</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350 Â°F</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the nuts and place them on a bake sheet. 
            If there is any residual powder left from the nuts, 
            don't place them on the bake sheet as they will burn</li>
        <li>Grill in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until the nuts 
            become fragrant. Remove from the oven</li>
        <li>Rub oil on another bake sheet and set aside</li>
        <li>Pour the honey and sugar into a large pan on medium heat. 
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until the boiling honey 
            darkens (about 5 minutes)</li>
        <li>Incorporate the grilled nuts using a wooden spatula. 
            Mix without stopping to coat the nuts and to continue 
            the caramelization for another 4 to 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Once the caramel is dark, pour it on to the already 
            oiled bake sheet. With the help of a spatula, 
            create an even, one-inch-thick, rectangular wafer. 
            Be careful: do not touch the caramel with your 
            fingers as it is perilously hot</li>
        <li>Let rest for ten minutes then, with a large knife, 
            cut it into squares or diamonds</li>
    </ol>
