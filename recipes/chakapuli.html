    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chakapuli is a Georgian traditional stew. Most popularly, lamb chops are used in chakapuli, 
        although veal or beef can replace it. Tarragon is the most prominent ingredient in chakapuli.

    <p>
        Chopped lamb is boiled with white wine in a deep pan, 
        and then the pan is placed in the oven and cooked slowly for 1.5 hours. 
        After this process, the tkemali sauce is stirred into the lamb, 
        and the chopped greens and garlic are added. The dish is then cooked for 
        another 5 minutes in the oven and finally rested for 5 minutes before serving.
